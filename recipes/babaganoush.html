        <p>Learn the secret to making the BEST Baba Ganoush!  Made with only FIVE simple ingredients this authentic Middle Eastern Eggplant Dip can be made on the grill, or baked in the oven.</p>
        <p><strong>What is Baba Ganoush?</strong></p>
        <p><strong> It originates from the Middle East and is often served with pita bread, olives, or vegetables as a flavorful appetizer. It’s one of my personal favorite recipes on the blog.</strong></p>
        <p>Baba Ganoush is a silky, luxurious combination of eggplant, tahini paste, garlic, lemon juice, and salt that is blended into the most creamy luscious dip.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggplants ( 1.5 to 1.75 lbs each)</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, finely minced (use a garlic press)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons tahini paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>optional: 2 tablespoons plain full-fat yogurt</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps to follow</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>Preheat oven to 450F ( 425F if electric oven)</li>
            <li>Slice eggplants in half, lengthwise and roast with flesh side down, on a parchment-lined sheet pan on the middle rack, until very tender, about 45-60 minutes.  Test by piercing the skin with a fork, and continue roasting until flesh is very tender and collapsing. Let cool.</li>
            <li>Scoop out flesh, drain in a strainer for 10 minutes. You should have about 2 cups, if less, see notes.</li>
            <li>Mash with a fork and add the remaining ingredients.  To achieve the smoky flavor, add a 1/4- ½ teaspoon of liquid smoke.</li>
            <li>Adjust salt and lemon to taste. Stir in optional yogurt.</li>
        </ol>
