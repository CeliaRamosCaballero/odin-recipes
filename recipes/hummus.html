        <p>Learn how to make hummus like a pro! I'm sharing my family's easy hummus recipe and expert tips for authentic, smooth, ultra cream hummus! And be sure to watch the video.</p>
        <p><strong>what is Hummus?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>It’s the quintessential Middle Eastern dip made by blending chickpeas with tahini, garlic, and citrus.</strong></p>
        <p>I grew up on it, and I'm convinced that this simple beige dip is some of the best stuff on earth! Creamy, satisfying and packed with plant-based protein.</p>
        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups cooked chickpeas, peeled (from 1 to 1 ¼ cup dry chickpeas or from quality canned chickpeas. See recipe notes for more instructions on cooking and peeling chickpeas)</li>
            <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>3 to 4 ice cubes</li>
            <li>⅓ cup  (79 grams) tahini paste</li>
            <li>½ tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>Hot water (if needed)</li>
            <li>Early Harvest Greek extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Sumac</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps to follow</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add chickpeas and minced garlic to the bowl of a food processor. Puree until a smooth, powder-like mixture forms.</li>
            <li>While processor is running, add ice cubes, tahini, salt, and lemon juice. Blend for about 4 minutes or so. Check, and if the consistency is too thick still, run processor and slowly add a little hot water. Blend until you reach desired silky smooth consistency.
            </li>
            <li>Spread in a serving bowl and add a generous drizzle of Early Harvest EVOO. Add a few chickpeas to the middle, if you like. Sprinkle sumac on top. Enjoy with warm pita wedges and your favorite veggies.</li>

        </ol>
